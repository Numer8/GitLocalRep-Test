"""
A small and easy-to-use port scanner program using the built-in module Socket.

It must be the first statement in the objectâ€™s (module, function, class, and method) definition.
You can access docstrings  using the following special variable: myobj.__doc__
e.g. print(theFunction.__doc__)
They should not be descriptive should describe what the function does, not how
and end with a period.

# FILE:
# Typically, a Python file is any file that contains code. Most Python files have the extension .py.
# SCRIPT:
# A Python script is a file that you intend to execute from the command line to accomplish a task.
# MODULE:
# A Python module is a file that you intend to import from within another module or a script,
# or from the interactive interpreter. You can read more about modules in the Python documentation.

# Put most code into a function or class.
# Use __name__ to control execution of your code.
# Create a function called main() to contain the code you want to run.
# Call other functions from main().

# What is the order of operations in Python? The same as the US
# acronym PEMDAS which stands for
# Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction

# Python Style guide: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
# Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
# Spaces are the preferred indentation method (not tabs)
# Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
# break before binary operations
# 2 blank lines around top-level function and class definitions
# 1 blank lines around Method definitions inside a class
# blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
# Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions.
# Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8
# IMPORTS should usually be on separate lines
# Naming Convention.............
# FUNCTION and VARIABLE names: lowercase words separated by underscores
# METHOD names and Instance Variables as function names.
# CONSTANTS: Words all capital letters separated by underscores.
# CLASS names: should normally use the CapWords convention.
